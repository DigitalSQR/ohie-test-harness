# Introduction

This project implements the supporting test services for the FHIR conformance testing. Currently, this provides an 
implementation of a GITB messaging and validation services. It also includes a simple web UI to review and complete
pending manual verifications given that this feature is not currently implemented in the core Test Bed software.

In terms of the application's packages (under `eu.europa.ec.fhir`):
* `gitb` includes the implementation of the GITB messaging and validation services.
* `handlers` includes the implementation logic for different actions.
* `state` includes everything needed to manage the ongoing state of test sessions.
* `utils` contains general utilities of a supporting nature. 
* `web` contains the controller for the application's simple UI.

The service is implemented in Java, using the [Spring Boot framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
It is  built and packaged using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), and also via Docker Compose.

# Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required:
* To build: JDK 17+, Maven 3.8+.
* To run: JRE 17+.

# Building and running

1. Build using `mvn clean package`.
2. Once built you can run the application in two ways:  
  a. With maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`.  
  b. Standalone: `java -jar ./target/fhir-test-services.jar`.
3. The services are available at:
  a. For the messaging service: http://localhost:8181/fhir/services/messaging?wsdl  
  b. For the validation service: http://localhost:8181/fhir/services/validation?wsdl
4. The web UI to view and complete pending manual approvals is at: http://localhost:8181/fhir/web/pending
5. For receiving calls from FHIR clients, the proxy services are exposed as follows:
  a. POST: http://localhost:8181/fhir/server/api/* (for example http://localhost:8181/fhir/server/api/AllergyIntolerance)

## Live reload for development

This project uses Spring Boot's live reloading capabilities. When running the application from your IDE or through
Maven, any change in classpath resources is automatically detected to restart the application.

# Using Docker

To build and package this application you can also use Docker Compose. Run `docker compose build` to build the application's
image and `docker compose up -d` to run it.
