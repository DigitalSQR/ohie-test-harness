            We could have just used the "interact" step directly in test cases and other scriptlets to present
            the help messages. However by doing it in a scriptlet we centralise the implementation of this as
            a reusable building block. This allows us to define in one place also the check on whether or not 
            we should be displaying such messages (based on the organisation's preference).

                    The "interact" step is used for user prompts. We can both show instructions and receive inputs
                    and manage multiple instructions/inputs in one go.

                    If we are running a test headlessly "interact" steps are skipped. This is fine for instructions
                    but may be problematic when we expect inputs. Inputs can be provided via the REST API to replace
                    values obtained through prompts but even this is not enough if the prompts are needed to collect
                    dynamic information during the test session.
