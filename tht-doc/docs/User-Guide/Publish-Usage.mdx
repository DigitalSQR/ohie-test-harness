# Publisher Usage

The publisher is a user responsible for verifying the results from the testing process. Ultimately, they decide whether to publish the results as a solution for all. The publisher has the following capabilities:

- **Report**: Identify and document any issues or discrepancies in the testing results.
- **View**: Review the results and assess their validity and completeness.
- **Publish**: Approve and release the solution for general use.

## [Application](#Application)

The Publisher will have separate credentials to log into the system. Once he logs in to the system he has to go to the **Application** section to either view or report or publish the solution.

- To publish the report click on the **Publish** button.

<ImageViewer src={Publisher3}/>

<ImageViewer src={Publisher4}/>
