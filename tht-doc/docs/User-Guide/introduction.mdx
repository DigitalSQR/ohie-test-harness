# Testing Harness Tool

The **Testing Harness Tool** is a sophisticated application designed to evaluate Health Care Systems based on OpenHIE standard rules. This tool facilitates two distinct testing processes to ensure comprehensive system evaluation.

## Manual Testing Process

The first process is a manual testing method where users respond to a series of specific questions designed to assess various aspects of the HMIS.

## Automated Testing Process

The second process is an automated testing method, where predefined test cases are executed, and the system automatically identifies whether the criteria have been met.

## Reporting

After completing both testing processes, the Testing Harness Tool generates detailed reports highlighting the system's compliance and conformance, ensuring that healthcare implementations meet the required standards.
