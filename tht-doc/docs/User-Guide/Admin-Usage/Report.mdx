# Report

Reports are generated automatically after the testing process is completed. There are two types of results generated based on the specifications:

1. **Compliance**: If the test for the Required specification passes then it is considered in the Compliance section.
2. **Conformance**: If the test for the Recommended specification passes then it is considered in the Conformance section.
