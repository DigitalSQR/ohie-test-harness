# Business Logic Tier

Upon successful authentication, the request proceeds to the controller where the secure execution of business logic begins. This central hub manages various business requirements, serving APIs for testing purposes. Interacting with the FHIR library to obtain FHIR resources for testing OpenHIE specifications, the system handles API calls from the Assessee's system for automated testing with an Automation Test Execution engine. Expanding on the business logic, a report generation module will create reports based on the test outcomes.

Using Java for business logic, especially with version 17, offers several advantages:

**Platform Independence:** Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle allows the code to be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing excellent platform independence.

**Robust and Reliable:** Java's strict compile-time checking and runtime checking contribute to robust code, reducing the likelihood of errors and enhancing reliability.

**Large Ecosystem:** Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, providing developers with a rich set of resources for building and maintaining applications.

**Multithreading Support:** Java's built-in support for multithreading facilitates the concurrent execution of tasks, improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.

**Security:** Java's security features, including its robust authentication and access control mechanisms, make it a secure choice for building enterprise-level applications.

**Scalability:** Java's scalability is well-demonstrated in large-scale enterprise applications, making it suitable for projects with growing demands and evolving requirements.

**Community Support:** Java has a large and active community, offering extensive support, documentation, and knowledge-sharing opportunities, which can be invaluable for developers.

**Compatibility:** Java's commitment to backward compatibility ensures that applications developed with earlier versions of the language can still run on newer versions, reducing the impact of updates and migrations.
