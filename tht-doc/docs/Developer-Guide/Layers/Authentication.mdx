# Authentication Layer
	
In the Authentication layer, we support both traditional username/password login and streamlined access through Google OAuth 2.0 for social login. Users can choose between standard credentials and the convenience of logging in using their Google accounts, providing a flexible and user-friendly authentication experience.

Incorporating Spring Security, our Authentication layer ensures robust authentication and authorization processes. Additionally, Spring Security provides CSRF protection, enhancing the security of our system by preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.
